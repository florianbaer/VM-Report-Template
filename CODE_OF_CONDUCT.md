# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the maintainers and contributors of the VM Report Template project, are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone—regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, level of experience, gender identity and expression, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Showing empathy and respect for different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Providing and receiving constructive feedback gracefully.
- Being mindful of how your words and actions may affect others.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the long-term health of the project.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment of any kind.
- Publishing others’ private information (such as a physical or email address) without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces, both virtual and physical, and in public spaces whenever an individual is representing the project or its community. Project representation can include the use of an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it through GitHub issues or contact the project maintainers directly. Reports will be handled as confidentially as possible.

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information (optional, but helpful for follow-up).
- Names or identifying details of the individuals involved.
- A description of what happened and when.
- Any supporting evidence (for example, screenshots or links).

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior. They may remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct and communicate reasons for moderation when appropriate.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions, as determined by the rest of the maintainer team.
